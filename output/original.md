# The Shape of the Essay Field

**June 2025**

An essay must convey information unknown to readers. However, there exist three distinct reasons why knowledge gaps occur, producing fundamentally different essay types.

First, people might not know something because it lacks importance. This doesn't preclude excellent essays. You could write compellingly about a specific automobile model, enriching readers' understanding. For some, it might spark profound insights. Yet unless the subject is extraordinary, everyone needn't comprehend it.

When knowledge isn't critical, there's no meaningful explanation for the gap—ignorance of random facts is normal. However, discussing important matters requires examining why audiences lack this knowledge. Do they possess intelligence but lack experience, or do they simply fail to grasp concepts?

The three categories emerge: (a) unimportant information, (b) reader obtuseness, or (c) reader inexperience.

This framework illuminates a potentially controversial observation that becomes evident through this analysis: "If you're writing for smart people about important things, you're writing for the young."

More accurately, that audience generates maximum impact. Your discoveries should remain somewhat novel to you personally, regardless of age—otherwise it isn't truly an essay, which fundamentally represents thinking through problems. Yet younger readers typically experience greater surprise than seasoned audiences.

A spectrum of surprise exists. At one end, literature transforms entire worldviews. "The Selfish Gene" accomplished this for the author, revealing how treating genes rather than organisms as evolutionary protagonists clarifies understanding. At the other extreme, essays merely articulate what readers already thought or believed they thought.

Impact equals changed thinking multiplied by topic significance. Excelling simultaneously proves difficult—major breakthroughs about important subjects remain rare. Consequently, a genuine tradeoff emerges: substantially change thinking regarding moderately important matters, or minimally shift perspectives on crucial ones. Younger audiences offer different dynamics. Their greater intellectual flexibility creates increased payoff for addressing important subjects.

This tradeoff operates unconsciously, resembling gravitational fields surrounding writers. Every essayist navigates it, consciously or otherwise.

Understanding this took considerable time. The author knew he wanted addressing intelligent readers about significant topics, and empirically recognized he reached younger audiences. Yet years passed before recognizing this as the inevitable outcome of those initial preferences. This realization emerged while composing this very essay.

Given this knowledge, should anything change? The author thinks not. Recognizing this field's structure has clarified that he isn't optimizing returns within it. Rather than surprising particular age groups, he pursues self-surprise.

His usual subject selection follows curiosity—noticing something novel and investigating thoroughly. Changing this approach would probably backfire. Yet this understanding prompts reflection. What captivates younger readers? Which important learnings typically arrive late in life? These represent worthwhile questions warranting consideration.

**Note**

Genuinely excellent essays about trivial topics prove difficult because skilled essayists inevitably deepen their subject matter. E. B. White wrote compellingly about potato-boiling while imparting timeless wisdom. In such cases, though, the essay transcends its nominal topic, using it merely as the entry point.
