# How To Be Successful

By Sam Altman

## Introduction

Altman shares observations from working with thousands of founders about achieving outlier success. He notes that people typically begin seeking wealth but ultimately pursue significance instead. He presents 13 principles for achieving exceptional results, acknowledging that while some prerequisite success helps, most insights apply broadly.

## 1. Compound yourself

The author emphasizes exponential growth as fundamental to wealth creation. Businesses growing 50% annually become massive quickly. Individuals should similarly pursue careers with compounding effects rather than linear progression.

"You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty" — your learning velocity should increase continuously.

Leverage comes through capital, technology, brand, networks, and team management. Altman prioritizes projects that, if successful, make his previous career seem insignificant. Long-term thinking provides competitive advantage since few adopt this perspective.

## 2. Have almost too much self-belief

Conviction is immensely powerful—the most successful people maintain nearly delusional confidence in themselves. This begins early and strengthens as you accumulate evidence of good judgment and consistent delivery.

Contrarian thinking creates value, yet requires self-belief to pursue. Altman recalls Elon Musk's certainty discussing Mars rockets as exemplifying necessary conviction.

However, self-belief requires balancing with self-awareness. Altman evolved from avoiding criticism to assuming feedback is true initially, then deciding whether acting on it serves him. "Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion."

## 3. Learn to think independently

Original thinking rarely appears in formal education, which typically rewards conformity. Entrepreneurs must cultivate independent thought themselves.

First principles thinking combined with testing ideas quickly is powerful. The entrepreneurial mindset accepts repeated failure: "I will fail many times, and I will be really right once."

Repeatedly solving seemingly impossible situations builds conviction in your problem-solving capacity. Grit develops through experiencing recovery after setbacks.

## 4. Get good at "sales"

Self-belief alone proves insufficient; you must persuade others of your vision through inspiring communication, charisma, and demonstrated execution ability.

Clear communication requires clear thinking first, then plain, concise language. "The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you're selling." Authentic enthusiasm creates better results than manufactured pitches.

Like any skill, sales improves through deliberate practice, though many avoid it thinking it's unteachable. Altman's key tactic: "show up in person whenever it's important." Three in-person visits early in his career created career-defining moments.

## 5. Make it easy to take risks

Most people overestimate danger while underestimating potential rewards. Taking chances proves essential since perfection is impossible.

Early career offers natural advantages for risk-taking since you have minimal obligations and maximum potential upside. Seek asymmetric bets: lose 1x if wrong, gain 100x if right, then increase your wager.

However, avoid becoming too comfortable. Tech company employees face particular difficulty leaving stable roles for uncertain ventures. "Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way" to pursue hunches, though trade-offs exist.

## 6. Focus

Focus multiplies work effectiveness. Most people should spend considerable time determining what deserves their attention rather than working excessively on wrong priorities.

Once identified, execute your small handful of priorities relentlessly and quickly. "I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful."

## 7. Work hard

Reaching the 90th percentile requires either intelligence or effort. Attaining the 99th percentile demands both—competing requires matching others' talent plus willingness to invest hours.

The life trade-offs are substantial, making this choice rationally optional. Yet momentum compounds: success facilitates further success. Many founders report increased happiness and fulfillment working toward maximum impact.

Hard work compounds like interest—starting early maximizes cumulative benefits. You should "figure out how to work hard without burning out," frequently by working alongside people you enjoy.

## 8. Be bold

Ambitious startups attract talent more readily than safe ones. People seek meaningful work where their contributions matter.

Pursuing important problems generates constant support. Embrace growing ambition rather than second-guessing it. "If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don't second guess it."

Follow your curiosity—what excites you typically excites others similarly.

## 9. Be willful

"A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don't even try." Self-doubt, premature quitting, and insufficient persistence limit most people's potential.

Request what you want. Rejection frequently occurs and stings, but success arrives when it works. Persistent individuals declaring "I will keep going until this works" ultimately succeed through providing luck adequate opportunities to materialize.

Airbnb exemplifies this: they survived numerous battles with competitors and financial strain until fortune favored their persistence.

Willfulness requires optimism—Altman notes never encountering highly successful pessimists.

## 10. Be hard to compete with

Just as companies gain value through competitive moats, individuals must become difficult to replace. Otherwise, eventually someone else performs your function cheaper.

Build leverage through personal relationships, strong personal brands, or expertise spanning multiple disciplines. Avoid mimetic behavior—doing what your peers do guarantees competitive vulnerability.

## 11. Build a network

Great achievements require talented teams. Your network of capable people often becomes your limiting constraint.

Helping people generously over extended periods generates most significant opportunities. Altman notes: "I'm continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago."

Develop reputation for generous upside-sharing with collaborators and excellent role placement. "You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out."

Strengthen team through complementary hires rather than clones of yourself. Acknowledge weaknesses without accepting them as limiting—delegate instead.

Discover undiscovered talent through observation: meet numerous people, track who impresses you over time, and prioritize improvement rate over current credentials. Ask whether someone demonstrates "force of nature" characteristics.

Finally, cultivate relationships with established figures willing to invest in you early. Pay this forward eventually by supporting others similarly.

## 12. You get rich by owning things

High salaries rarely produce extreme wealth despite popular misconception. Forbes list members almost universally achieved riches through ownership rather than compensation.

"You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value"—whether business equity, real estate, natural resources, or intellectual property. Ownership scales exponentially while time sales scale linearly.

The path involves creating things people desire at scale, generating rapid appreciation.

## 13. Be internally driven

Most people pursue external validation through impressing others, creating two significant problems.

First, external motivation drives consensus thinking and consensus career paths, discouraging truly original work. You become excessively concerned with others' approval, preventing genuinely interesting pursuits.

Second, external focus corrupts risk assessment. You overemphasize short-term competitive positioning rather than accurate probability calculations.

Highly successful individuals are primarily internally motivated—driven by self-satisfaction and compelling visions rather than external impression. After acquiring sufficient wealth and status, external motivation disappears, leaving only internal drive. "It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren't obsessed with."

Success ultimately derives from excellent work in personally important areas. Starting early in this direction creates maximum distance traveled. Motivation quality is paramount—difficult to codify but recognizable when present.
