# Good Writing

Writing can be good in two ways: it can sound good, and the ideas can be right. These seem unrelated, yet they're connected. Writing that sounds good is more likely to be right.

I first noticed this from my own experience. When I've had to rewrite a passage to make it fit into a space, the result has always been better. Sometimes it's obviously better: I've made the ideas clearer or more accurate. Other times the writing is merely smoother. But I've never made a passage *worse* by rewriting it to fit.

This puzzled me for a while. What was the connection between space constraints and quality? Then I realized: fixing sentences that sound bad seems to help get the ideas right.

Why would this be so? Constraints can make you more creative. Like shaking a bin of objects to make them pack more tightly, constraints can shake writing into a better form. When you're forced to fit a passage into less space, the parts that aren't working tend to get shaken out.

But there's more to it than that. When a passage doesn't fit, you don't just cut words at random till it does. You think about how to express the same ideas more efficiently. And that's how you discover that some of the ideas were half-formed, or that you didn't mean exactly what you said, or even that you were saying something that wasn't quite true.

When you improve the sound of your writing, you're not just making it easier to read. You're making it easier for yourself to tell whether it's true.

Good writing is easier to read, and easier to read means you notice more when you do. The writer is the first reader. If a passage is awkward, the writer will notice when they reread it. But if it flows smoothly, they might not catch an error in it. The better writing sounds, the more carefully you can examine it.

This helps explain why good writing has rhythm. Rhythm isn't just ornamental. When the rhythm of a sentence matches the movement of the ideas within it, the sentence is easier to understand. And when writing is easy to understand, you can see the ideas more clearly—including seeing when they're wrong.

An essay is a cleaned-up train of thought. When you rewrite to improve the sound, you're following that train back to its origin, checking each link along the way. If a link is weak, the rhythm will be off.

This only works when you're writing to figure something out. It doesn't apply to writing where you already know exactly what you want to say, like a scientific paper describing a particular experiment, or a textbook chapter explaining an idea already explained a thousand times before. In that kind of writing, all you can control is the presentation.

It doesn't apply either when what you're writing is false. You can make false ideas sound good by "method acting"—almost believing them temporarily. But if the ideas are internally consistent, the writing will sound good even though it's not true. So the mere fact that writing sounds good doesn't prove it's true.

When writing sounds bad and the ideas are bad, those are usually related. But when writing sounds good, the ideas might or might not be true.

The connection between sounding right and being right is not a proof. It's more like a rope, with many overlapping connections between the two. Good writing doesn't guarantee good ideas, but it makes them more likely.
